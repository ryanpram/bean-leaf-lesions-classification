# Bean Leaf Lesions Classification
## Problem and Project Description
Bean crops are susceptible to various diseases, and early detection of these diseases is crucial for ensuring a healthy harvest. One common issue is the development of leaf lesions, which can be caused by diseases such as angular leaf spot, bean rust, or may indicate a healthy leaf. Traditional methods of disease diagnosis can be time-consuming and may not provide timely information for effective intervention.

In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model for the automated classification of bean leaf lesions into three classes: angular leaf spot, bean rust, and healthy. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we intend to create a robust solution that can accurately identify and classify lesions based on images of bean leaves.

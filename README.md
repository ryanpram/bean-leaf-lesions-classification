## Problem and Project Description
In the realm of professional football, a player transfer takes place when a player, under contractual obligations, transitions from one club to another. This intricate process involves the official relocation of a player's registration from their current football club to a new one. Typically, the transfer initiation occurs when a representative from an interested club officially inquires with the club where their prospective player is currently registered. If the selling club expresses an openness to the idea, negotiations commence for a transfer fee. These negotiations are often facilitated by intermediaries and involve determining the financial compensation to be paid by the acquiring club. However, price negotiations between clubs are time-consuming and lack standardization. Nowadays, the player's current club often aims to maximize the price for their player, contributing to significant inflation in the football player market value.

This project is dedicated to the prediction of football players' market values, drawing insights from their in-game, profile, and attribute statistics. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a valuable tool for clubs, agents, and enthusiasts, enabling them to assess and comprehend the market value of players. The predictive player valuation model can help professional clubs to setting a reasonable starting point for negotiations regarding a player's price.
